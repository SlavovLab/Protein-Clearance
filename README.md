Analysis from Leduc and Slavov (2025): Protein degradation and growth dependent dilution substantially shape mammalian proteomes

To reproduce the analysis used to generate figures, the following two R scripts can be run:
- External_data_and_simulation.R for plots from figure 1 and 2
- Tissue_metabolic_labeling.R for plots from figure 3 and 4

Both scripts call functions from the Functions_for_analysis.R script. 
The starting point should be making sure all the packages that are loaded in the begining of the functions script are installed.

These scripts read in data files that are store on Zenodo so there should be no need to download any additional data.
